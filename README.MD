This is a clone of Icy Tower written in C++ using SFML. 

You need to provide your own assets - this README.MD will be updated with all asset information needed.
Accuracy and faithfulness to the original game was very important, and I think it turned out great, keeping in mind that this is my first real C++ project.

Special thanks to the original creators and legends of Icy Tower and its legacy - Johan Peitz and Anders Svensson!

Things I may add in the future:
- sign sprites behind the number of a platform
- main menu
- launcher with config options
- replays

There will be no features which do not exist in the original games as that would not make sense for a clone. The clone may be extended to an all new project at one point.
