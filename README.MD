This is a clone of Icy Tower written in C++ using SFML. 

You need to provide your own assets - this README.MD will be updated with all asset information needed.
Accuracy and faithfulness to the original game was very important, and I think it turned out great, keeping in mind that this is my first real C++ project.
Special thanks to the original creators and legends of Icy Tower and its legacy - Johan Peitz and Anders Svensson!
